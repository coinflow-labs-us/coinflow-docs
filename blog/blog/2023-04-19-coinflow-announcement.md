# Web3 Payment Infrastructure Solutions Provider Coinflow Labs Raises $1.45M to Expand Web3 Payment Stack

_Pre-Seed Round Led by Jump Crypto and Reciprocal Ventures, with Participation from CMT Digital, DCG,
and Gumi Crypto Among Others_


**CHICAGO, IL – April 19, 2023** - Coinflow Labs (“Coinflow”), a web3 payment stack provider, today
announced the closing of its $1.45 million pre-seed round. The round was led by Jump Crypto and
Reciprocal Ventures, with participation from CMT Digital, Digital Currency Group, Gumi Cryptos, Builder
Capital, Prompt Ventures, Blocktech Ventures and various angel investors following Coinflow’s
participation in the Pit, Jump Crypto’s hub for innovators.


Founded in 2022 and led by experienced full stack software engineers with expertise in web3 gaming
and consumer applications, Daniel Lev and Ben Meeder, Coinflow is working to strengthen the bridge
between traditional banking infrastructure and blockchain technology to seamlessly onboard web3
consumers.


Coinflow Labs' innovative web3 payments infrastructure solution aims to provide a simpler, more secure,
and efficient way for Web3 companies to accept traditional payments such as credit cards. Coinflow
offers a comprehensive web3 payment stack that allows web3 companies to accept traditional payment
methods for things such as buying NFTs with a credit card. Coinflow’s off-ramp product allows customers
to move cryptocurrency from self-custody wallets instantly to their bank accounts using existing
real-time payment rails.


Currently, Coinflow’s products are live on the Solana, Near, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchains, with the
intention to expand to additional chains. Coinflow has secured partnerships with Web3Auth, a
non-custodial auth infrastructure provider, and Tier 1 US Banks for payment processing and off-ramp
services. The company is also an early adopter of the United States’ FedNow program which enables
financial institutions to deliver end-to-end faster payment services to their customers and is anticipated
to launch in late 2023.


> "Amid unprecedented market volatility and uncertainty across the entire global financial system, there
exists a unique opportunity to bring efficiency, security and trust to payments systems, especially within
the evolving web3 space. We developed
Coinflow to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology and make it easier for
non-crypto native customers to engage across the web3 ecosystem, including interacting with games,
wallets and other web3 consumer products. With the support of our investors and partners, we look
forward to onboarding additional customers and building FinTech 2.0, the next generation of financial
blockchain technology."

\- Daniel Lev, Co-Founder and CEO of Coinflow Labs


> "At Reciprocal, we back founders who are fueling the expansion of the web3 ecosystem, and we’re
thrilled to support Coinflow, a foundational company revolutionizing the web3 payments landscape.
Coinflow is enhancing the accessibility of web3 consumer products through streamlining integration with
user-friendly checkout and off ramps. We’re excited to
collaborate with the highly experienced team at CoinFlow and be part of their journey to enable the
future of commerce." 
 
\- Josh Kuzon, Partner at Reciprocal Ventures.


Coinflow’s funding will enable the company to further accelerate its product, software and business
development initiatives, onboard new customers, and expand its team.
