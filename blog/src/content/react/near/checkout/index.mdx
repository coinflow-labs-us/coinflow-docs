# Configure the Coinflow Purchase Component

Add the `CoinflowPurchase` component into your UI and configure the props with the following information:

- `wallet` - The Near Wallet
- `merchantId` - Your Merchant ID
- `env` - Use `sandbox` for testing and `prod` for production
- `blockchain` - The Blockchain you are using (in this case, `near`)
- `onSuccess` - (optional) A callback function that is called when the purchase is successful
- `email` - (optional) Email of the user that will be prefilled for them

# Configure the Near Transaction (Optional)

Initialize a Near transaction FunctionCall action calling your program exactly like you normally would for a user traditionally paying
with USDC. Coinflow will take care of the rest!

Pass this transaction into the `transaction` property of the `CoinflowPurchase` component. You will also be required to set the `amount` property to be
the amount of USDC you are sending to the program.
