## Configure the Solana Transaction

Initialize a Solana transaction calling your program exactly like you normally would for a user traditionally paying
with USDC. You will also be required to set the amount property to be the amount of USDC you are sending to the program.

[Read more about how to customize a Solana purchase transaction here](https://docs.coinflow.cash/docs/solana).
