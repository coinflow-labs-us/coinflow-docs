# Connect to a Wallet

In this example, we hard code a wallet and pass it along to the CoinflowPurchase component. You can customize your wallet's functionality to fit your preferences, as long as 
the return type matches Coinflow's expected wallet interface, as outlined below:

```
{  
    publicKey: PublicKey;  
    sendTransaction: (transaction: Transaction) => Promise<string>;  
}
```

</ContentBlock>
