## Wallet connection

Utilizing a wallet connector like Wagmi streamlines the process of accessing your wallet, making it easier to manage your funds. In this example, we demonstrate how to connect to your wallet with Wagmi. 

Note: If you choose to implement another wallet connector, skip to "Wallet functionality".

You can customize your wallet's functionality to fit your preferences, as long as 
the return type matches Coinflow's expected wallet interface, as outlined below:
```
{  
    address: string;  
    sendTransaction: (transaction) => Promise<{hash: string}>;  
    signMessage: (message: string) => Promise<string>;  
}
```
