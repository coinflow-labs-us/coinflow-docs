# Withdraw

Coinflow withdraw enables your platform to payout users’ balance. Making it easy to make crypto to fiat payouts helps 
you pay out your customers faster, leading them wanting to return in the future. Best of all, you can use Coinflow 
payouts with your existing integration and avoid managing crypto wallets yourself: your platform’s funds can remain in 
fiat and Coinflow will handle converting funds to USDC and paying out in fiat.


Coinflow’s payout product is connected to the U.S.  Real-Time-Payments network, which lets you your users withdraw 
their balance right to their fiat bank, instantly.
