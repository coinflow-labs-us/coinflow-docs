# Checkout

## Overview

Coinflow Checkout is a low-code integration to allow you to build a customized payment page to accept traditional 
payment methods (Credit Cards and ACH), or crypto wallets. The checkout is fully customizable and you can integrate it 
directly into your application.


Coinflowâ€™s technology interacts with any smart contract. The underlying technology enables the digital asset 
transactions to be categorized as a digital good/service so stringent KYC verification isn't required, which makes 
the checkout experience much faster and cheaper for users.

## Pre-built UIs

Coinflow offers a suite of embeddable, pre-built UIs to help you quickly and securely integrate common checkout
workflows into your application. These pre-built UIs are fully customizable to your application's look and feel.
Additionally, all of our UIs are built with security in mind and are fully PCI-compliant. Utilizing our UIs will
allow your team to focus on your product instead of wasting time on compliance and security.

## Transactions

When you enable Coinflow Checkout, your users can buy digital assets and interact with your smart contract with a 
credit card, fiat bank, or by connecting their crypto wallet. 

To complete a purchase directly with your smart contract, you will need to pas in a `transaction` to the `CoinflowPurchase`
component. The `transaction` object should be constructed exactly like the user is making a USDC purchase. This means
for all supported chains, there is no difference in the transaction you pass between a user making a purchase with 
USDC, or them using their credit card. Coinflow takes care of all the complexities for you.

## Saved Cards

Cards for users are saved between purchases meaning that a user will only need to put in their credit card
details a single time. This improves conversion on subsequent purchases and reduces friction for your users. 

Coinflow is fully PCI-compliant and does not save this data directly on our servers.
